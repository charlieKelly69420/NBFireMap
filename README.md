## Features

- Esri Imagery basemap with custom panes and z-indexing for clean stacking.
- **NB Active Fires** split by status (Out of Control, Contained, Under Control, Being Patrolled) with rich popups.
- **Canadian wildfire perimeters** with auto-labels visible at higher zoom.
- **Fire Summary drawer**: counts, new today/yesterday, and total burned area with quick zoom to fires.
- **Environment Canada weather stations**: animated wind arrows with speed, temperature, and humidity.
- **NOAA radar** (time-enabled base reflectivity image service).
- **MSC GeoMet lightning density** (WMS).
- **AQHI stations** with category-coded badges.
- **Sentinel-2 imagery overlay** (optional).
- **VIIRS & MODIS hotspots** (last 48h / 7d).
- **Smoke forecast layer** (Canada).
- **Aircraft positions** from the OpenSky Network API.
- **NB boundary, crown lands, burn bans** overlays.
- Major NB city labels.
- Mobile-friendly UI with layer toggle and location control.

## How the Map Works

- **Layers & Popups:** Each layer has custom rendering, tooltips, and popups tailored for clarity.
- **Perimeter Labels:** Shown only at zoom ‚â• 11 to reduce clutter.
- **Fire Summary Panel:** Aggregates NB active fire data with Atlantic Time ‚Äúnew today/yesterday‚Äù tracking.
- **Aircraft:** Live aircraft positions over NB, heading-aware, with highlighted callsigns.
- **Mobile UX:** Toggle UI controls for a clean view.

## Errors & Omissions

This project relies on multiple live open-data services. Data availability, timeliness, and accuracy may vary. Some layers may be temporarily unavailable or load slowly. This map should not be considered authoritative for safety decisions‚Äîalways refer to official government channels for emergency information.
